Because of their expensive nature, signature loans with no credit check generally aren't worth it unless you have no other option. Almost any other loan type or credit card will put you in a better financial position and charge lower interest rates and fees as you pay the money back.

A few things to remember about signature loans with no credit check:

You're typically only borrowing money for a few weeks or a few months.
Interest rates can easily be 400% or higher during that time.1
Payday loans are typically meant to be paid off with a lump sum, so they're not a good long-term borrowing option.
The loan company will want a postdated check or an approved bank transfer so they automatically get paid on your loan's due date.
A range of hidden fees can apply, including late fees, returned payment fees, and more.
